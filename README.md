# MEAN
All about MEAN stack.
The project includes an Express REST API and it's Angular front-end. All CURD operations are performed.
Usage:
- cd to both file directories and run: npm install 
- Run both servers using npm start.
- API runs on localhost:69 and Angular runs on localhost:4200
- Gotta curd 'em all, okay?
